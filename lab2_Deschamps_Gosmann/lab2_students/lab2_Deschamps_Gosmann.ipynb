    "\n",
    "**Objective**: this lab explores some aspects of orthogonal wavelet transforms in 2D for image processing, with applications to denoising and filtering. All the numerical illustrations covered in this session rely on the Python module `Pywavelets`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wavelet is determined by its low-pass filter or scaling function (in french _fonction d'échelle_). The longer this filter (*i.e.*, the more coefficients it contains), the larger the number of null moments. For instance, Daubechies wavelets are composed of $p=2k$ coefficients, for $k$ null moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger number of null moments allows regular signals/images to be better compressed. However, an extended support of the wavelet can be problematic to represent highly irregular regions of the signal, such as discontinuities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a wavelet is a matter of compromise, depending on the type of structures expected to be observed in the image of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines**: after retrieving the resources for the lab on moodle:\n",
    "- place the .zip archive in a local folder (Computer -> Documents/Python/);\n",
    "- unzip the archive .zip;\n",
    "- rename the folder with the convention lab2_Name1_Name2;\n",
    "- duplicate the notebook file and rename it lab2_Name1_Name2.ipynb;\n",
    "- at the end of the session, do not forget to transfer your work to your own network space if you are working on a machine from the school (do not leave your work on the C: drive).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assessment** &#8594; global grade from F to A (A+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessmment based on your answer to the exercises reported in the notebook and any additional `.py` file produced. Custom code should be commented whenever appropriate. Figures should be clearly annotated (axes, title).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numerical correctness\n",
    "2. Implementation clarity (documentation, relevance of the comments)\n",
    "3. Answers to the questions and overall presentation of the Jupyter notebook."

This can be explained by the fact that the `haar` wavelet has very low resemblance to the original signal, so the supression of the details coefficients 5 is more noticeable on all frequencies. This can also be explained by spectral leakage phenomenon associated to `haar`. On the other hand, `db20`, expect for certain frequencies that were suppressed, seems to display a very good reconstruction. This can be explained by the fact that `db20` has a chirp-like, frequency-modulation-like shape, so it makes sense that the approximation coefficients would be more adequate to represent the original signal."
